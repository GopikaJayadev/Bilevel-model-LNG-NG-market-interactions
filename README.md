# Bilevel-model-LNG-NG-market-interactions

This repository contains the supplementary material and parameter files for the paper titled "Strategic interactions between liquefied natural gas and domestic gas markets: A bilevel model".

The supplementary material presents a simplified version of the model presented in the paper along with relevant analytical insights that can be drawn from the model. These analytical insights provide a detailed understanding of the model structure and the interactions between the LNG operator and NG producer using a preliminary model and analysis for a single LNG operator and NG producer setting.

The excel file contains the numerical values for the various model parameters that are used in the case study presented in the paper.
